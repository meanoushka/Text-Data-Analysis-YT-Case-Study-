# Text-Data-Analysis-YT-Case-Study-
In this text data analysis project, data of YouTube was used by me.
I performed EDA for positive and negative comments. I analyzed which
category received the most likes, the relation between the category of
the video and the number of likes received, the engagement of audience
and the relationship between views and likes received. I also analyzed
whether the presence of punctuations in titles had any relation with
views, likes and comments of the videos.
